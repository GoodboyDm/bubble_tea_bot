You are my Python developer. In this Repl, create a working Telegram bot for a small bubble tea shop.

Technical requirements:
- Language: Python.
- Library: aiogram (latest stable version).
- No webhooks, no FastAPI, no Flask. Use ONLY long polling with asyncio.
- All logic must be in main.py.
- Use a local SQLite database file called sales.db for storing sales.
- Do NOT hardcode the bot token. Read it from an environment variable named TELEGRAM_TOKEN.

Database:
- Create a table "sales" with the following fields:
  - id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
  - datetime TEXT (ISO format, e.g. "2025-11-26 13:45:00")
  - drink_name TEXT
  - category TEXT        -- e.g. "Milk & Tea", "Coffee", "Italian Soda", "Others"
  - size TEXT            -- e.g. "Hot", "Iced", "Frappe"
  - price REAL
  - payment_type TEXT    -- "cash", "qr", "other"

Bot features:
1) /start
   - Send a short welcome message and show an inline keyboard:
     - "New sale"
     - "Today report"

2) New sale flow (use inline keyboards step by step):
   - Step 1: choose category (Milk & Tea, Coffee, Italian Soda, Others).
   - Step 2: choose drink inside that category (use a few example drinks, you can hardcode names in a Python dict).
   - Step 3: choose size: Hot / Iced / Frappe (if a drink does not support a size, skip it).
   - Step 4: automatically determine the price from a Python dict MENU[category][drink][size].
   - Step 5: ask for payment type: cash / qr / other (inline buttons).
   - After confirmation:
     - write a row into the "sales" table;
     - send a message "Sale saved ✅ Amount: XX ฿" to the user.

3) Today report:
   - Command: /report or inline button "Today report".
   - Calculate:
     - total number of sales for today;
     - total amount (sum of price);
   - Reply for example:
     "📊 Today: 12 sales, total 850 ฿"
   - Date for "today" is based on the server local date (no time zones needed).

Code structure:
- At start, check and create the sales.db and table if they do not exist.
- Create a Python dict with a small example menu, for example:
  MENU = {
      "Milk & Tea": {
          "Thai Tea": {"Hot": 25, "Iced": 30, "Frappe": 45},
          "Green Tea": {"Hot": 25, "Iced": 30, "Frappe": 45}
      },
      "Coffee": {
          "Nescafe": {"Hot": 25, "Iced": 35, "Frappe": 45}
      }
  }
- Use aiogram's FSM or a simple in-memory dict to store the current sale state for each user during the New sale flow.

What you must deliver:
- Install aiogram using pip in this Repl.
- Implement the full bot in main.py.
- Add clear comments in the code explaining:
  - where to set the TELEGRAM_TOKEN env variable in Replit;
  - how to run the bot (which button to press in Replit).
- Make sure the code runs without errors when I run "python main.py" in the Replit console.
